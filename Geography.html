      <h1>Geography</h1>
      <p>
        Located in Southern and Southeast Europe, Greece consists of a
        mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the
        southern end of the Balkans, ending at the Peloponnese peninsula and
        strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Approximately 80% of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the
        country one of the most mountainous in Europe.
        <br />
        Greece features a vast number of islandsâ€”between 1,200 and 6,000,
        depending on the definition, 227 of which are inhabited.
      </p>

      <h2>Climate</h2>
      <p>
        The climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean featuring mild to cool,
        wet winters and hot, dry summers. This climate occurs at most of the
        coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese,
        Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, and parts of mainland
        Greece.
        <br /><br />
        The mountainous areas and the higher elevations of northwestern Greece
        as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese including
        parts of the regional units of Achaea, Arcadia, and Laconia feature an
        Alpine climate with heavy snowfalls during the winter.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        <br />Most of the inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia,
        the lower elevations of Western Macedonia and Eastern Macedonia and
        Thrace feature a humid subtropical climate with cold, damp winters and
        hot, moderately dry summers with occasional thunderstorms. Snowfalls
        occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief periods
        of snowy weather are possible even in low-lying southern areas, such as
        Athens.
