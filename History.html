      <h1>The Ancient Greece: When, Where and How the Greek Empire Existed</h1>
      <p>
        In this article, we explore the history of ketchup: by whom and when the
        ketchup was invented, what the original ketchup recipe was, and how this
        source influences our everyday life and even culture.

        The first ketchup recipe included neither tomatoes, vinegar, nor many
        other ingredients that make ketchup well… ketchup. The first base of the
        sauce was fish, then oysters, mushrooms, and only after that – tomatoes.

      <h1>When was Ketchup Invented, and Who Did It?</h1>
      <p>
        Ketchup has a surprisingly long evolution that originated in China. The
        first version was based on pickled fish and looked more like a soy sauce
        – with a dark and thin texture. It was called “keh-jup” or “koe-cheup,”
        meaning “fish sauce.” Thanks to the fermentation, the sauce was easy to
        conserve and could make a long journey. So, eventually, at the beginning
        of the 18th century, British and Dutch merchants brought ketchup to
        Europe. There, the cooks tried to recreate the recipe and, as a result,
        added some new ingredients. But it was still far from the dip we know
        today.
